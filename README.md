# Personal website

After about two years without a place on the internet, I thought that it was about the time. So here it is 
ðŸ¤“.

### What I've used:
- [Gatsby default starter](gatsbyjs.com).
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).
- [Chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/). 

### How to use it:
  * You can simply clone this repo.
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/olegesan/personal-site
    # change cwd to personal-site
    cd personal-site
    # install dependencies
    npm install
    ```
  * Or you can get it using gatsby CLI.
    ```shell
      # create a new Gatsby site using this repo as a starter template
      gatsby new name-of-your-folder https://github.com/olegesan/personal-site
      ```
